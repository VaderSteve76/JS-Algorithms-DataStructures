What is sorting?
  Sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection(e.g. an array)
  so that the items are in some kind of order. Sorting is an incredibly common task,
  so it's good to know how it works. There are many different ways to sort things,
  and different techniques have their own advantages and disadvantages.

    // ES5 Swapping function
      function swap(arr, idx1, idx2) {
        var temp = arr[idx1];
        arr[idx1] = arr[idx2];
        arr[idx2] = temp;
      }

    // ES2015
    const swap = (arr, idx1, idx2) => {
      [arr[idx1], arr[idx2]] = [arr[idx2], arr[idx1]];
    }
