Insertion Sort:
  Builds up the sort by gradually creating a larger left half which is always sorted.
  Starts by picking the second element in the arr. Now compare the second element with
  the one before it and swap if necessary. Continue to the next element and if it is in the
  incorrect order, iterate through the sorted portion(left) to place it in the correct place.
  Repeat until array is sorted.
