Radix Sort:
  Radix sort is a special sorting algorithm that works on lists of numbers.
  It never makes comparisons of elements. It exploits he fact that information
  about the size of a number is encoded in the number of digits. More digits
  means a bigger number.

Radix Sort Helpers:
  In order to implement Radix sort , it's helpful to build a few helper functions.

  getDigit(num, place) - returns the digit in num at the given place value

  digitCount(num) - returns the number of digits in num

  mostDigits(nums) - given an array of numbers, returns the number of digits 
    in the largest numbers in the list


Radix Sort Pseudocode:
  Define a function that accepts lists of numbers. Figure out how many digits
  the largest number has. Loop from k=0 up to this largest number of digits.
  For each iteration of the loop create buckets for each digit(0-9) place 
  each number into the corresponding bucket based on its kth digit then
  replace our existing array with values in our buckets, starting with 0 
  and going up to 9. Return the list at the end.
