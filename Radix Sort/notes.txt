Radix Sort:
  Radix sort is a special sorting algorithm that works on lists of numbers.
  It never makes comparisons of elements. It exploits he fact that information
  about the size of a number is encoded in the number of digits. More digits
  means a bigger number.

Radix Sort Helpers:
  In order to implement Radix sort , it's helpful to build a few helper functions.

  getDigit(num, place) - returns the digit in num at the given place value

  digitCount(num) - returns the number of digits in num
