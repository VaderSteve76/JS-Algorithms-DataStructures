Recursion:
  1. Define what recursion is and how it can be used (function that calls itself until base case is met,invoke the same function with a different input until you reach base case)
  2. Understand the 2 essential components of a recursive function
  3. Visualize the call stack to better debug and understand recursive functions
  4. Use helper method recursion and pure recursion to solve more difficult problems

Helper Method Recursion:
  An outer function that is not recursive that calls an inner function that is recursive

  function outer(notRecursive) {

    function inner(isRecursive) {

    }

  }

Pure Recursion:
  1. For arrays, use methods like slice, spread operator and concat so you don't mutate the arrays
  2. Strings are immutable so you need to use slice, substr, or substring to make copies
  3. To make copies of objects use Object.assign, or the spread operator
