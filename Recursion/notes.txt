Recursion:
  1. Define what recursion is and how it can be used (function that calls itself until base case is met,invoke the same function with a different input until you reach base case)
  2. Understand the 2 essential components of a recursive function
  3. Visualize the call stack to better debug and understand recursive functions
  4. Use helper method recursion and pure recursion to solve more difficult problems
