Selection Sort:
  Similar to bubble sort, but instead of first placing large values
  into sorted position, it places small values into sorted position
    1. Store the first element as the smallest value seen so far
    2. Compare this item to the next item in the array until you find
    a smaller item
    3. If a smaller item is found, designate that smaller item to bubble
    the new "minimum" and continue until the end of the array
    4. If the "minimum" isn't the value(index) you initially began
    with, swap the two values
    5. Repeat this with the next element until the array is sorted
