Binary Heaps:
  Very similar to a binary search tree, just with different rules.
  In a MaxBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always larger than child nodes.
  In a MinBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes.

  Side note:
    For any index of an array n...
    The left child is stored at 2n + 1
    The right child is at 2n + 2
    For any child node at index n...
    Its parent is at index (n-1)/2

  MaxBinaryHeap:
    Each parent has at most 2 child nodes. The value of each parent node
    is always greater than it's child nodes. In a MaxBinaryHeap the parent 
    is greater than the children, but there are no guarantees between sibling
    nodes. A binary heap is as compact as possible. All the children of each 
    node are as full as can be and left children are filled out first.
