Doubly Linked List:
  Same as a singly linked list except has a pointer in both directions
  pointing to the prev node and next node. Uses more memory because of
  pointers in both directions.


Push:
  Adding a node to the end of the doubly linked list.

  Push Pseudocode:
    Create a new node with the value passed to the function.
    If the head property is null set the head and tail to be
    the newly created node. If not, set the next property on
    the tail to be that node. Set the previous property on 
    the newly created node to be the tail. Set the tail to be
    the newly created node. Increment the length. Return the 
    doubly linked list.
