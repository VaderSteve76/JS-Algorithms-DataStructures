Quick Sort:
  Like merge sort, exploitshe fact that arrays of 0 or 1 elements are already sorted.
  Works by selecting one element(called pivot) and finding the index where the pivot
  should end up in the sorted array. Once the pivot is positioned appropriately,
  quick sort can be applied on either side of the pivot.

Pivot Helper:
  In order to implement Merge Sort, it's useful to first implement a function responsible
  for arranging elements in an array on either side of the pivot. Given an array, this
  helper function should designate an element as the pivot. It should then rearrange
  elements in the array so that all values less than the pivot are moved to the left
  and all values higher than the pivot are moved to the right. The order of the 
  elements on either side of the element doesn't matter. The helper should do this 
  in place and not create a new array. When complete the helper should return the index.
