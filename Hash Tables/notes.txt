Hash Table:
  Hash tables are used to store key-value pairs. Like arrays but the keys
  are not ordered. Unlike arrays, hash tables are fast for all of the 
  following operations: finding values, adding new values, and removing.
  Nearly every programming language has some sort of hash table data structure.
  Because of their speed, hash tables are very commonly used.
