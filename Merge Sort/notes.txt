Merge Sort:
  It's a combination of 2 things - merging and sorting. Exploits the facts
  that arrays of 0 or 1 element are always sorted. Works by decomposing an array
  into smaller arrays of 0 or 1 elements, then building up a newly sorted array.
  In order to implement merge sort, it's useful to first implement a function
  responsible for merging 2 sorted arrays. Given 2 arrays which are sorted, this
  helper function should create a new array which is also sorted and consists of
  all of the elements in the 2 arrays. This function should run in O(n+m) time
  and O(n+m) space and should not modify hte params passed to it. 

Merging Arrays:
  Create an empty array, take a look at the smallest values in each input array
  If the value in the first array is smaller than the value in the second array,
  push the value in the first array into our results and move on to the next value
  in the first array. If the value in the first array is larger than the value in the
  second array, push the value in the second array inot our results and move on to the
  next value in the second array.
