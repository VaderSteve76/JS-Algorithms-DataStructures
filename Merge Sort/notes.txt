Merge Sort:
  It's a combination of 2 things - merging and sorting. Exploits the facts
  that arrays of 0 or 1 element are always sorted. Works by decomposing an array
  into smaller arrays of 0 or 1 elements, then building up a newly sorted array.
  In order to implement merge sort, it's useful to first implement a function
  responsible for merging 2 sorted arrays. Given 2 arrays which are sorted, this
  helper function should create a new array which is also sorted and consists of
  all of the elements in the 2 arrays. This function should run in O(n+m) time
  and O(n+m) space and should not modify hte params passed to it.
