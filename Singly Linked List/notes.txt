Linked List: 
  A data structure that contains a head, tail and length property.
  Linked Lists consist of nodes, and each node has a value and a 
  pointer to another node or null.

  Comparisons with arrays:

    Lists:
      Do not have indexes!
      Connected via nodes with a next pointer
      Random access is not allowed

    Arrays:
      Indexed in order!
      Insertion and deletion can be expensive
      Can be quickly accessed at a specific index


  Pushing Pseudocode:
    This function should accept a value. Create a new node using the value
    passed to the function. If there is no head property on the list, structure
    the head and tail to be the newly created node. Otherwise set the next property
    on the tail to be the new node and set the tail property on the list to be the
    newly created node. Increment length by 1. Return the linked list.
