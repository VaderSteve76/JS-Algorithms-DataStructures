Searching Algorithms:
  The simplest way to search for a value is to look at the data
  and to check if it's the value we are looking for. Javascript has 
  search methods built in ie. indexOf, includes, find, & findIndex

Linear Search:
  1. This function accepts an array and a value
  2. Loop through the array and check if the value is equal to what you're looking for
  3. If it is return the index at which the element is found
  4. If the value is never found return -1
