Objective:
  1. Define what an algorithm is

  2. Devise a plan to solve algorithms

  3. Compare and contrast problem solving 
     patterns including frequency counters
     two pointer problems and divide & conquer


Definition of alogrithm:
  A process or set of steps to accomplish a task

How to i,prove:
  1. Devise a plan
  2. Master common problem solving patterns


Understand the problem:
  1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
  2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
  3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution?
  4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs?
     In other words, do I have enough info to solve the
     problem?
  5. How should I label the important pieces of data
     that are part of the problem?
