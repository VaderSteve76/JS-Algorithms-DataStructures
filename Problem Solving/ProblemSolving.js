// Write a function that takes two numbers and returns the sum

// 1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
// 2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
// 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution?
// 4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? (do I have enough info??)
// 5. How should I label the important pieces of data?


function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};

add(5, 5);
