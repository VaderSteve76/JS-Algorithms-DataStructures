Queues:
  A FIFO data structure. Are used in background tasks, uploading/downloading
  printing/task processing.

  Enqueue Pseudocode:
    This function accepts some value. Create a new node using that value passed
    to the function. If there are no nodes in the queue, set this node to be the
    first and last property of the queue. Increment the size of the queue and return
    the queue.
